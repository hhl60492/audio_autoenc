# audio_autoenc
Experiment with audio and neural networks in Tensorflow

Source code adapted from https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/examples/3_NeuralNetworks/autoencoder.py

Summary: Experimental deep autoencoder for raw audio waveforms. The objective is to learn th identity function on the 10sec 16bit, 44kHz 
audio clip. First stage for further experiments with deep learning and audio processing.
